An original retro-fusion concept album, presented as the soundtrack to a fictional game.<br><br>

The primary goal of this project was to create a soundtrack that communicates the narrative, emotions and nuances of a hypothetical game, through the music, titles and album cover alone. The score features complex interwoven motifs and recurring elements tied to implied characters, locations, narrative elements and themes.
