METAL NEST is a short, minimalistic game with a heavy focus on immersive and engaging sound design, created as a solo project. You are put in the place of a nomadic beast, left to wander a surreal and oppressive industrial structure.<br><br>

With this project, I wanted to utilise the potential of positional audio to create a series of contrasting environments that have a strong sense of physicality and space, despite the fairly minimal aesthetic. This involved layering and blending many recorded, sourced and processed audio tracks in a 3D space, as well as realtime custom effects like dynamic reverb and position-based attenuation. The end result is an atmospheric experience that draws you deep into the dark, gritty industrial ruins, leaving you to contemplate the vast mysteries within. 

This project was created in Unity, heavily utilising FMOD integration for the audio implementation.
