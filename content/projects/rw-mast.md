The Mast is a popular and highly-regarded mod for the video game Rain World, featuring a considerable expansion to the game world and a full original soundtrack, as well as custom sound design elements.<br><br>

Alongside the composer and sound designer, I fulfilled the roles of level designer and overall project lead. The mod’s production also involved collaborating with programmers to implement custom music triggers and other more advanced code features.
