Fathomless is a short atmospheric horror-management game about holding a failing starship together until help arrives. The player is put into the shoes of a crew member desperately trying to maintain the obtuse, failing systems of a decaying ship, transferring power, repairing systems and fending off unknown horrors until help (?) arrives. 
<br>

The release version of Fathomless, a collaboration between 4 developers including myself, was created for and subsequently won the *MiniJam 173* game jam. I was a key contributor in many aspects of development, as a lead sound designer, programmer and game designer, also contributing to level design and 3D asset creation.
