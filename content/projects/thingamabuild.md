This project had a team of around 6, and I was acting as the leader of this project, managing tasks and ensuring everything was done on time. I was also involved with many aspects of the gameâ€™s creation, including the composition and sound design, programming several features, and doing a portion of the spritework.

This project was made in Godot in 96 hours, for the GMTK Game Jam.
