Within the Rain World community, I’ve contributed to many other projects with music, primarily designed for the game’s procedural “threat music” system – layered scores triggered dynamically by nearby dangers.<br><br>

These pieces are designed from the ground up to be played dynamically, with a unique percussive techno-tribal aesthetic custom-fit for the wildly varied locations. Instruments can also play in randomised combinations, making for a unique arrangement style.

These projects involved close collaboration with mod developers, to ensure the music was thematically fitting and appropriately intense.
